# Specific to your project if HENS_plot/output.txt is generated by C++
# HENS_plot/output.txt # 如果output.txt是由C++程序生成的，并且你不想跟踪它

# If output.txt IS generated by C++ AND you want the Python script to read it from a fixed relative path
# but you DON'T want to commit the C++ generated output.txt, then ensure your Python script
# can handle a missing output.txt or you have a placeholder/example one committed.
# A common strategy is to have C++ output to build/output.txt and Python read from there.

# If output.txt is MANUALLY created or a STABLE input for Python, then DON'T ignore it.
# output.txt # 取消注释这一行，如果你希望output.txt被跟踪
